We will accomplish the final task by completing each task in the project:

* <b>Introduction</b>: A brief explanation of the topic and goals we hope to achieve, as well as a demo of the final model we design.
* <b>Task 1</b>: Exploratory Data Analysis + Visualization
* <b>Task 2</b>: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* <b>Task 3</b>: The Naive Bayes Model
* <b>Task 4</b>: Highlighting shortcomings of model and implementing small changes to improve performance
* <b>Task 5</b>: Use advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to improve model performance and address class imbalance (subword units
