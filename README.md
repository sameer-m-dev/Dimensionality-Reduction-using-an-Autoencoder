# Dimensionality Reduction using an Autoencoder in Python

We will accomplish the final task by completing each task in the project:

* <b>Task 1</b>: An introduction to the problem, as well as a summary of the imports we will need
* <b>Task 2</b>: Dataset creation and preprocessing relevant for our tasks
* <b>Task 3</b>: Using PCA as a baseline for model performance
* <b>Task 4</b>: Autoencoder Training
* <b>Task 5</b>: Reducing dimensionality using the encoder half of an autoencoder within scikit-learn (parts 1 & 2)
